# Project #1 – Lexical Analyzer  
**CSCI 316: Principles of Programming Languages**

This project is part of a semester long series exploring core concepts in programming languages.

`LexerExample.java` implements a **lexical analyzer** for a small subset of the Java programming language.

The lexer processes an input file character by character and:

- Identifies valid tokens
- Classifies each token according to the language specification
- Reports lexical errors for invalid input sequences

The supported subset of Java is defined in detail in the comments at the top of the source file.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how lexical analysis works using:

- Finite State Machines (FSM)
- State transition tables
- ASCII character classification
- Token recognition logic

This project builds foundational understanding for later phases of a compiler, including parsing and semantic analysis.
